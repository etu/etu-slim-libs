* Etuâ€™s Slim Framework 4 helper libraries
This is an opinionated set of libraries for using Slim Framework 4 that has
some care and thought put into error handling and logging.

It comes with the following custom bits:
 - Custom exceptions that supports something that works like PSR-3 context
   and specifying the log level for each exception type
 - Custom error handler to handle these exceptions and log levels
 - Custom shutdown handler to log using the error handler
 - Response helper to make it easier to write responses.

It's built to use with composer, Slim 4, Monolog (or other PSR-3 interface).

I have a template implementation for using these libraries here:
